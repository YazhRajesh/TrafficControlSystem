The problem of urban traffic congestion is constantly spreading. The increase in traffic is due to the growing number of vehicles and the limited expansion of roads. We propose a system for reducing traffic congestion using image processing by detecting blobs and tracking them. The system will detect vehicles through images instead of using electronic sensors embedded in the pavement. We also plan to provide a suitable solution for emergency vehicles stuck in traffic to clear the route by using Bluetooth, thus assuring timely help to those in need.
